# Eye Exercise

<img src="Eyes.png" width='300'/>

Description:

In this exercise there is a set of eyes in the middle of the screen. Wherever we move our mouse the eyes follow us there.

How to Run:

Simply drag the Index.html file directly from the directory folder. Then you can move your mouse around to see the eyes follow it around.

Roadmap of future improvements:

I would like to make it so that the eyes are constantly changing to different colors of the rainbow. I would also like to have the eyes periodically shoot lasers so that you have to dodge them with your mouse. There could be a counter for the number of lasers that you have dodged. If your mouse gets hit by the lasers then the game resets.
